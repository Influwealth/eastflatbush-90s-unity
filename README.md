# East Flatbush Block-Twin Capsule (E 91st - E 98th)

A sovereign, coordinate-accurate digital replica of the East Flatbush corridor, specifically the blocks of E 91st, 92nd, 93rd, 94th, and surrounding streets.

## 📌 Mission: Geospatial Sovereignty
This is not a generic simulation. It is a building-by-building reconstruction of the physical community for:
- **Urban Planning**: Community-led design.
- **Economic Simulation**: Tracking value and assets on specific plots.
- **Historical Preservation**: An exact 1:1 record of the neighborhood structure.

## 🧱 Data Components
- /unity/Assets/Capsules/CityTwin/Data/footprints.json: Exact GPS coordinates of buildings.
- /automation/generate_map.py: Script to extrude 3D buildings from real-world plot data.
